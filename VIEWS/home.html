        <h1>Welcome to My Student Website!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my website! I am thrilled to have you here as you explore the principles and techniques of HTML5, along with routing functionality implemented using Express.js. This website serves as a hands-on demonstration of various HTML5 features, including its semantic elements, multimedia support, and modern web APIs. You’ll also find dynamic content generated through routing in Express.js, where different routes serve data based on specific criteria. Whether you’re interested in learning about web development, experimenting with HTML5, or exploring how data can be routed dynamically, you’ll find plenty of useful examples throughout this site. I hope you enjoy exploring the demos, and I look forward to helping you understand the power of HTML5 and web technologies!</p>

            <h2>Introduction to HTML5:</h2>
            <p>This site utilizes HTML5, a modern markup language that is used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. HTML5 brings several improvements over previous versions of HTML, such as new semantic elements, enhanced multimedia support, and more powerful APIs. Some of its key features include the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tags, which allow developers to create more meaningful and accessible web content. HTML5 also supports the integration of audio and video elements directly into web pages without the need for external plugins. Overall, HTML5 makes websites more interactive, responsive, and user-friendly, allowing developers to build richer and more engaging online experiences.</p>
